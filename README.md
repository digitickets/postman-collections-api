# Example Postman Collections for the DigiTickets API

This repo contains Postman collections that provide examples of how to use the DigiTickets API.

## Getting started

In order to make use of these examples you will need access to test company. If you do not have a test company please [contact DigiTickets](https://www.digitickets.co.uk/contact).

You can use the `DigiTicketsAPI.postman_environment.json` file which will need to be populated with:

- apiUser
- apiPassword
- apiUrl

Depending on the nature of the collections that you wish to use you will need to create Categories, Tickets, Products, etc. in your test company. The values for these can then be used as 'collection variables' to allow you to run and work with the collections.
